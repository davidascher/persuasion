x redis is persistence layer
x store each slide contents as jade, convert on the fly

P1
- add slide after, before (+,a, +,b)
- delete slide (- + confirm)
- change slide master (aka css stylesheet)
- figure out commenting system & auth (could have impact on data model)
- comments: each slide should have an (authenticated) comment queue
- allow inline editing of divs/spans
- site bar slides down if hover in top?
- control panel slides up if hover in bottom?
- setup basic auth with stupid IDs for now

# oauth will require running on public url - not sure how to do dev work w/ that.
  - authentication:
  - if you login, you can mark a deck private
  - if you make a deck private, you can say who you want to have read/comment access


P2
- add keyboard shortcut HUD
- reorder slides (later, needs real UI)
- non-stock bespin colors, just for branding
- UI navigation control panel somehow (see 'hud')
- figure out a way to indicate what went wrong if jade markup is off.
