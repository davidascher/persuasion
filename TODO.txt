- non-stock bespin colors, just for branding
- navigation control panel somehow (see 'hud')
- store each slide contents as jade, convert on the fly
- allow inline editing of divs/spans


- redis is persistence layer

schema:

- presentations: list of presentation ids
- presentation-<pid>-slides: list of slide ids
- presentation-settings: json blob corresponding to presentation settings (default css, author?, time created, etc.)
- slide-<pid>-<sid>: json blob used to generate slide sid of presentation pid
- slide-<pid>-<sid>-comments: list of comments made about this slide

the process to generate an HTML slide out of a json blob is:
  - convert into JS
  - run JS through set of transformations (include css)
  each of those is an html fragment, who are all aggregated into one
