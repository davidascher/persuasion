[bugs]
- before starting to edit, removeClass('ui-editable') from everything
- after adding a new slide or after editing, enable double-click-to-edit

[flickr]
- persist flickr urls with the slides
- allow people to find a different picture (either by tag or just chance)
  and pretty-print the html
- auto-generate credits page
- browser for backgrounds (cc-licensed, tags, colors, etc.)

[ux]
- merge watercooler & notes using bryan's suggestions
- allow manipulation of divs:
 - create new divs
 - delete existing divs
 - change div class (get rid of h1/h2/header etc/)
  - allow change slide master (aka picking css stylesheet - each css stylesheet should be
    prefixed by a slide class:  slide.fancy .header {}, slide.business .header {}
  - deck should load all CSS (fancy, business, that any of the slides use -- )
  - master-picker would need to load them all.
- reorder using > and < -- move slide right & left.
- indicate connection/deconnection
- add keyboard shortcut HUD
- figure out modes: presenting (i notify you when to move slides), collaborating, read-only
- distinguish new comments, and ack or delete comments?

[later]
- figure out something for embedded graphics/sketches
- allow JS callbacks on enter/leave of a slide
- allow non-linear decks

[cleanup]
- test suite
- cleanup js code, it's getting ugly
- use client.on("error", function (err) {}); to get rid of extra error logging
- clean up publish/subscribe stuff - move to redis pubsub, but only for scale?

[social]
  - make URLs use username as part of path (establish strong ownership of decks)
  - allow cloning of decks (and keep track of who cloned in both directions.)
  - if you login, you can mark a deck private
  - if you make a deck private, you can say who you want to have read/comment access
  - use username on comment if logged in.
  - allow liking of decks
  - leaderboard for public decks (most views, most likes, most current active readers)
  - leaderboard for your decks

[graphics]
- non-stock bespin colors, just for branding
- different default css
- more than one stylesheet to choose from!

[docs]
- make initial slide deck a tutorial
