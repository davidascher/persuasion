CLEANUP

P1
- delete slide (- + confirm)
- change slide master (aka css stylesheet)
- move away from jade, try to do basic inline & offer full html for geeks.

 -- to keep jade, i'd have to detect in the UI which changes to jade need to be
    made to match the UI-direct change.  that will mean either converting html back to jade, or
    mapping UI operations to Jade diffs.
    
- actually use authentication:
  - if you login, you can mark a deck private
  - if you make a deck private, you can say who you want to have read/comment access
  - use username on comment if logged in.

- use client.on("error", function (err) {}); to get rid of extra error logging


P2
- add keyboard shortcut HUD
- rework keyboard ui for comments.
- mark comments as "ack" and delete.
- reorder slides (via zoom out and direct manipulation!)
- non-stock bespin colors, just for branding
